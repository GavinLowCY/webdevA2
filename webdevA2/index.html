            Bees are winged insects in the superfamily Apoidea with 20,000+ species. There are many roles that
            certain bees are assigned to, such as queen bee and worker bees. They collect nectar from flowers and
            unintentionally help pollinate flowers, making them a crucial part to maintaining the flora and fauna in
            a sustainable ecosystem.

            Some species are: Carpenter bees, Honey bees and Leafcutter bees. <br>
            Some roles are queen bee and drone bees, which focuses on mating with each other for reproduction. Worker
            bees, which can be further segregated into
            more specific roles are primarily focused on maintaining the hive and production of honey.

            Bees have the roles of a pollinator in the ecosystem. They help to pollinate the flowers while foraging for
            nectar which will become honey.
            This helps the flowers to reproduce which is a core part of an ecosystem, ensuring sustainability in the
            ecosystem.

                1. The honey that is produced by bees have about 17%-20% of water content, making it very difficult to
                spoil due to
                the lack of water for mold and other micro-organisms to live in it. However, its viscosity, is one of
                the highest among
                all organic liquids like oil, water, alcohol etc. <br>

                2. Bees do a "Waggle Dance" that can communicate with other bees in the hive to tell others where food
                can be found. The vibrations and sounds
                produced by the quick flapping of their wings also help to communicate between each other. <br>

                3. The hexagon tiles of a honeycomb in a beehive has Mathematics, Physics and Biology all in play. <br>
                The layout of the hives uses Mathematics and Physics, while the heat dispersion in the hive uses
                Biology.
